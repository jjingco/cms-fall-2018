To allow WordPress to upload files with a size bigger than 2M...

Find the php.ini file in your system.
Usually in C:\xampp\php\php.ini

Back it up (copy it and rename the copy php.ini.bak)

Edit php.ini and change the following lines:
post_max_size=2M          ->  change value to 20M
upload_max_filesize=20M   ->  change value to 20M

Save php.ini
Restart apache

Rock'n'roll
