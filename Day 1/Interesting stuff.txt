Portfolio Advice:
- Do out-of-class research on a framework/project
  - write a report on it that critiques it and/or talks about your perspective and opinion of it, and any challenges you ran into with it
  - show case a small project you did with it
  - potential employers are interested in your perspective - how you think, how your mind works
