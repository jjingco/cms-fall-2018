- Services (with the following posts)


Assurance & Accounting

        *Our personal approach and our dedicated interest in your continued success means that we work very hard to learn all we can about you…and your business. In this way we can develop a customized approach to assist you in achieving all your goals, not just at tax time or financial statement preparation time, but throughout the year, and year after year. It is our personal goal to become your "most trusted advisor".


Corporate Advisory

        *One of the hallmarks of client service at Catalyst is the notion of having deeper relationships with fewer clients. Nowhere is this more apparent than with our Corporate Advisory Services Group. Dealing with the unique challenges, difficult problems, untapped opportunities and the related complexities of these types of situations is what we thrive on.

         Our years of experience in the areas of Valuations, Mergers and Acquisitions and Business Strategies provide you with the expertise and customized solutions you and your business need.

   
     
Taxation Advisory

        *While tax compliance and return preparation is a necessary requirement under Canadian law, this is not where your tax planning or strategizing should occur.

         We proactively work with private companies and their owners to plan and structure tax solutions that add value, long before the tax return ever gets prepared. Adding value can mean different things to different people. For some it may mean reducing an overall tax burden today. For others it may mean adequately planning for the future, such as a tax effective transition of a business to another generation or key employees.

   
     
Wealth Advisory

         *Wealth means different things to different people. It can be a burden to some and provide a sense of freedom to others. For most, wealth comes with a sense of responsibility and the desire to protect, preserve, and build it.

          We are passionate about helping you achieve your financial goals. Through our planning process, we help you identify and define the financial needs and goals that are most meaningful to you, so we can focus our expertise on your most important issues. This allows us to add immediate value and helps us build a strong relationship with you into the future.
