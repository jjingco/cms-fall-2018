Begin your Glacier experience on the east side. Hike to Grinnell Glacier or head a north to see Chief Mountain. Spend your night at Many Glacier Hotel on Swiftcurrent Lake. The next day, drive the Going-to-the-Sun Road, to the west side for another night. This road is the only road that goes through the heart of the park. After your drive, watch the sun set onLake McDonald before grabbing dinner at Belton Chalet. The next day, take Highway 2 for views of the southern landscape. Keep an eye out for the Goat Lick Overlook to spot mountain goats. Then take the twisty, but scenic Highway 49, the Looking Glass Road, before finishing your trip in East Glacier.


From scenic day-hikes to backcountry treks, there’s plenty of trails to cross in Glacier National Park at any level.


Start your day early with breakfast at the Base Camp Café in Columbia Falls. Pack a picnic lunch before driving along the scenic North Fork Road on the edge of Glacier National Park to get to Polebridge. Once there, stop for a treat at the Polebridge Mercantile.

Head a little further north for a hike to Bowman Lake. This trail has amazing views and great paddling at Kintla Lake. After a long day of activities,  make your way back into Columbia Falls for dinner at the Three Forks Grille.
