Camping

Locals know that the best way to experience the great outdoors in Montana is to camp.

Hiking & Backpacking

From scenic day hikes to multi-day wilderness excursions, there’s plenty of Montana to explore. Spend a day hiking through the alpine meadows to a lake in Glacier National Park, or spend a week exploring the backcountry of Yellowstone.



Golfing

In Montana, the eagles on the links aren’t from your game. They’re real. And so are the deer and the elk, but keep your eye on the ball.

From the Jack Nicklaus designed Old Works course in Anaconda to the spectacular Eagle Bend in Bigfork, the hazards on the course are hardly man-made. Montana boasts more than 70 golf courses. From first-class resorts to elegant country clubs to delightful “country” courses, Montana is the perfect place to swing away.
