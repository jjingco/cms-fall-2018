Start your day early with breakfast at the Base Camp Café in Columbia Falls. Pack a picnic lunch before driving along the scenic North Fork Road on the edge of Glacier National Park to get to Polebridge. Once there, stop for a treat at the Polebridge Mercantile.

Head a little further north for a hike to Bowman Lake. This trail has amazing views and great paddling at Kintla Lake. After a long day of activities,  make your way back into Columbia Falls for dinner at the Three Forks Grille.


Enter Yellowstone National Park after a drive on the Beartooth All-American Road.  Allow time to experience the Lamar Valley’s prime viewing opportunities of wolves, bison, elk and grizzlies.

Next stop is the terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs. In addition to this natural attraction, the NorrisGeyserAlbright Visitor Center provides excellent historical background for everything you see in the park. There is a hotel at Mammoth and lodging just outside the park in Gardiner for a pleasant evening surrounded by nature.

Exit the park to the north via Gardiner and head to Chico Hot Springs. Stay in this historic hotel, eat at the excellent restaurant, hike or ride horseback around the area in the summer, snowmobile or dogsled in the winter, and – of course — enjoy the hot springs.
